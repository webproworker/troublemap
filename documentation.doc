Requirements:

- Users can easily find and locate which are the problems in their cities
- The application needs to allow users without much experience to use it without hassle
- Users should quickly add and report new problems they observe
- Pictures can be added for a better description of the problem
- Users can add comments
- Set the gravity of the problem by votes. Authors and visitors can vote to decide the gravity (with grades from 1 to 5).
- The application should work on slow computers and be compatible with major browsers
- The application should work fine and look good on mobile devices as well
- The interface should be very user friendly, easy to use and intuitive
- The map should be centered on user's location when he is on the homepage
- Mayors or other individuals responsible for fixing the problem should be announced via email as soon as it arises (automatic reporting)

Non-functional requirements 
- Speed: The application needs to be fast enough to provide users with a pleasant experience and allow them to input and get the information quickly and easily. It should be as fast as possible so users don't have to wait for it to load.
- Performance: The application needs to perform well. So the stored files need to be of small sizes and compressed - for example stylesheets and javascript files. Also the code should be as optimized as possible. This has benefits not only on the page loading speed (therefore improving the user experience as wel), but also on the server stress. Small files and optimized code leads to less need for server maintenance and costs.

Then, based on the type of the problem, an email about it will be automatically sent to local councilors or officialities responsible for fixing the problem.
